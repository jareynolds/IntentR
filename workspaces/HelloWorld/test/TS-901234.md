## Gherkin Scenario

```gherkin
@TS-901234
Scenario: Navigation state transitions handle component errors gracefully
  Given the user is navigating between components
  And a component encounters an error during mounting
  When the navigation system attempts the transition
  Then the error should be caught and handled
  And the user should see an appropriate error message
  And navigation should fallback to a safe component state
```
