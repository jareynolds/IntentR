## Gherkin Scenario

```gherkin
@TS-893456
Scenario: Application maintains state consistency during component lifecycle
  Given multiple React components are active
  And the application runtime state is being managed
  When components undergo mount, update, and unmount cycles
  Then the global application state should remain consistent
  And component state transitions should be tracked
  And no orphaned state should exist
```
