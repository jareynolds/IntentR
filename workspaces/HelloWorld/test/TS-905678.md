## Gherkin Scenario

```gherkin
@TS-905678
Scenario: Performance optimization handles real-time weather data updates efficiently
  Given the weather application is receiving real-time data updates
  And multiple components display weather information
  When weather data is updated frequently
  Then UI updates should be debounced appropriately
  And only changed data should trigger component updates
  And the user interface should remain responsive during updates
```
