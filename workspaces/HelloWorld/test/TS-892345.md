Scenario: Coordinate AI and weather API services for complex query
  Given a user asks "Compare temperatures between New York and London this week"
  When the query processing begins
  Then AI service should identify comparison request and two locations
  And weather API should be called for both cities
  And forecast data should be retrieved for the week
  And AI should generate comparative analysis
  And formatted response should be prepared for display
```
