## Gherkin Scenario

```gherkin
@TS-465829
Scenario: Large weather datasets load using lazy loading
  Given the application needs to display extensive weather data
  When the user requests detailed weather information
  Then components should load lazily as needed
  And initial page load time should be minimized
  And user interactions should remain smooth during data loading
```
