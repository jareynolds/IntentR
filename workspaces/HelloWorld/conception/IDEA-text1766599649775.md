## Description
To-Do
1.) the capabilities form needs to be improved so that when the analysis button is pressed that it gives options of how it interpreted that capability to look.
2.) same for enablers.
3.) split markdowns into standard folders.
4.) flush out testing better and control loop
5.) how to handle bugs? do they go into Jira - and then how would they get interpreted appropriately back into IntentR?
