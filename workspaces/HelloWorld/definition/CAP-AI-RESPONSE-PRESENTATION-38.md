## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Manages the display and presentation of AI-generated weather insights and responses from the OpenWeather API. This capability formats, renders, and presents conversational AI responses in a user-friendly manner, ensuring that complex weather analysis and natural language responses are clearly communicated to users through the web interface.

### Value Proposition
Derived from STORY-DISPLAY-PROMPT-RESULTS which focuses on displaying AI prompt results after 'the openweather API returns the results from the AI prompt'. This is distinct from basic weather data display and specifically handles the presentation of AI-generated content, supporting the strategic themes STRAT-DEMONSTRATE-HOW-PROMPT-WEATHER-CAPABILITIES-WORK-2 and STRAT-LEVERAGE-AI-CAPABILITIES-3.

### Success Metrics
- AI response display time under 2 seconds
- User comprehension rate of AI responses above 90%
- Response formatting accuracy rate above 98%
