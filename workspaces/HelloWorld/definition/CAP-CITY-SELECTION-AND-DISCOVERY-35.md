## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Enables users to discover and select cities for weather information through multiple input methods including dropdown selection from popular cities, manual text entry with validation, and intelligent city lookup services. This capability ensures users can easily find and access weather data for any desired location while maintaining data accuracy through city name validation and geographic verification.

### Value Proposition
Derived from IDEA-text1766425190421 which specifically requests 'let the user enter their own city besides the prefilled ones' and STORY-ENTER-CITY which describes giving users 'the capability to manually select a city from popular cities from the drop down or even manually enter it' with city name validity checking.

### Success Metrics
- City lookup success rate above 95%
- Average time to select a city under 30 seconds
- User satisfaction with city selection interface above 4.5/5
