## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Provides the foundational infrastructure for running the weather application as a React.js web application in browser environments. This capability ensures proper application initialization, startup sequencing, environment configuration, and runtime stability across different web browsers and devices.

### Value Proposition
Derived from STORY-ENVIRONMENT which states 'this application must run in a web browser and is written in react.js' and STORY-START-APP which represents the application startup process. The vision VIS-A-SIMPLE-HELLO-WORLD-AS-A-WEATHER-APP-USING-PUBLIC-REST-APIS-1 emphasizes the need for a simple, accessible web application.

### Success Metrics
- Application startup time under 3 seconds
- Cross-browser compatibility rate above 98%
- Runtime error rate below 0.1%
