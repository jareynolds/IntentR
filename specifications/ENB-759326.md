## Technical Context

### Purpose

Enable the `ubecli` command to be executed from any directory on the system by providing installation mechanisms that add the binary to the system PATH. When invoked, ubecli operates on the current working directory and its subdirectories, loading project-specific configuration files (.ubecli.yaml, CLAUDE.md, etc.) from the working directory.

### Architecture Fit

This enabler extends the existing UbeCLI binary distribution by adding:
- Makefile targets for building and installing to system-wide locations
- Shell profile integration for PATH modification
- Version management and upgrade capabilities

### Existing Patterns to Follow

- Follow Makefile patterns from existing build targets (e.g., `make build`, `make docker-build`)
- Use standard Go cross-compilation patterns for multi-platform support
- Follow Unix conventions for binary installation (/usr/local/bin)

## Acceptance Scenarios (Gherkin)

### Test Suite: TST-759326 - Global Installation Tests

```gherkin
@TST-759326
Feature: UbeCLI Global Installation
  As a developer
  I want to install ubecli globally
  So that I can use it from any directory

  Background:
    Given Go 1.21+ is installed
    And the IntentR repository is cloned

  @TS-759401 @FR-759101 @critical
  Scenario: Build ubecli binary
    Given I am in the IntentR repository root
    When I run "make ubecli"
    Then a ubecli binary should be created in cmd/ubecli/
    And the binary should be executable
    And running "./cmd/ubecli/ubecli -version" should display version info

  @TS-759402 @FR-759102 @critical
  Scenario: Install ubecli to system PATH
    Given ubecli binary has been built
    When I run "sudo make install-ubecli"
    Then ubecli should exist in /usr/local/bin/
    And running "which ubecli" should return "/usr/local/bin/ubecli"
    And running "ubecli -version" should work from any directory

  @TS-759403 @FR-759103
  Scenario: Uninstall ubecli from system PATH
    Given ubecli is installed in /usr/local/bin/
    When I run "sudo make uninstall-ubecli"
    Then ubecli should not exist in /usr/local/bin/
    And running "which ubecli" should return empty

  @TS-759404 @FR-759106 @critical
  Scenario: UbeCLI operates on current working directory
    Given ubecli is installed globally
    And a project exists at "/tmp/test-project" with .ubecli.yaml
    When I run "cd /tmp/test-project && ubecli -p 'test'"
    Then ubecli should load configuration from /tmp/test-project/.ubecli.yaml
    And context files should be loaded relative to /tmp/test-project

  @TS-759405 @FR-759105
  Scenario: Version information includes build details
    Given ubecli is built with version embedding
    When I run "ubecli -version"
    Then the output should include the version number
    And the output should include the build date
    And the output should include the git commit hash
```

### Test Scenario Summary

| Scenario ID | Name | Requirement | Priority | Status | Automation |
|-------------|------|-------------|----------|--------|------------|
| TS-759401 | Build ubecli binary | FR-759101 | Critical | Draft | Pending |
| TS-759402 | Install to system PATH | FR-759102 | Critical | Draft | Pending |
| TS-759403 | Uninstall from system PATH | FR-759103 | Medium | Draft | Pending |
| TS-759404 | Operates on working directory | FR-759106 | Critical | Draft | Pending |
| TS-759405 | Version includes build details | FR-759105 | Medium | Draft | Pending |

## Test Architecture

- **Framework**: Go testing + shell scripts for integration
- **Coverage Target**: 80%+
- **Test Types**: Unit (Go), Integration (shell scripts)
- **Step Definition Location**: `cmd/ubecli/install_test.go`
- **Feature File Location**: `test/features/installation.feature`

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Test version string formatting
- Test build flag parsing

### Integration Testing

- Test full build → install → verify → uninstall cycle
- Test cross-directory execution
- Test configuration loading from various directories

### End-to-End Testing

- Install on clean system and verify functionality
- Test upgrade from previous version

---

## Implementation Hints

### Suggested Approach

1. Add Makefile targets for `ubecli`, `install-ubecli`, `uninstall-ubecli`
2. Use Go ldflags to embed version/build information
3. Create `scripts/install.sh` for advanced installation options
4. Update main.go to use embedded version info

### Known Gotchas

- macOS may require `sudo` or user to add /usr/local/bin to PATH manually
- Windows requires different installation approach (no /usr/local/bin)
- Go modules mode requires specific build flags

### Reference Implementations

- Existing Makefile patterns in project root
- Similar tools: `gh` (GitHub CLI), `kubectl` installation patterns
