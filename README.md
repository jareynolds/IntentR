# UbeCode - Design- and Capability-Driven Software Development

## What it is any why it matters
UbeCode is an open-source platform for DESIGN- and CAPABILITY-driven software development, treating capabilities as the structural backbone that connects specification, design, delivery, and AI governance.


## Why UbeCode Exists
Modern software teams operate across an increasingly fragmented toolchain—design systems, backlogs, repositories, AI assistants, and collaboration tools—none of which share a common understanding of what the system is actually intended to do.

This fragmentation was tolerable when delivery speed was constrained by human implementation. With AI-assisted development, that constraint has shifted.

As AI accelerates code generation, the primary bottleneck is no longer execution—it is specification.
Most existing agile and scaled agile frameworks were not designed for this reality. They optimize for managing work, not for expressing intent, governing AI behavior, or preserving architectural clarity at scale.

UbeCode is built around SAWai (Scaled Agile With AI)—an evolution of scaled agile practices specifically designed for AI-amplified software development.

SAWai is based on several core principles:
Specification-first development
When AI can generate implementation rapidly, the quality of vision, ideation, and specification becomes the dominant success factor.
A structured, four-phase workflow
SAWai formalizes the lifecycle of software intent and delivery into four explicit phases:
Specification — Define what to build (Vision, Themes, Ideation, Storyboarding)
Definition — Define the scope (Capabilities, Epics)
Design — Define how it looks and behaves (UI assets, frameworks, styles)
Execution — Build and run (System, Code, Runtime)
Capability-driven hierarchy
SAWai simplifies traditional agile hierarchies by treating capabilities as the primary unit of intent, with epics representing scoped delivery and implementation details serving as execution specifications.
AI-amplified delivery with governance
AI is not an add-on tool, but a governed participant in the development process, guided by explicit principles, constraints, and traceability back to the capabilities it affects.
Existing tools struggle to support this model because they are artifact-centric—tickets, boards, files, and pipelines—rather than capability-centric.
UbeCode exists to provide a unified, open-source platform that operationalizes SAWai by making capabilities the first-class abstraction that connects specification, design, delivery, collaboration, and AI governance in a single, coherent system.


## Quick Start
UbeCode is designed to be explored quickly, without requiring deep setup or prior framework knowledge.
Prerequisites
Git
Node.js (LTS)
Docker (recommended for local and cloud environments)
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/<org>/ubecode.git
cd ubecode
2. Set Up Your Development Environment
UbeCode provides environment-specific setup scripts to streamline local and cloud development.
Choose the script that matches your environment:
./setup-osx-environment.sh
./setup-win-environment.sh
./setup-aws-environment.sh
./setup-gcp-environment.sh
Each script installs required dependencies, configures services, and prepares the environment for running UbeCode.
Refer to the script contents if you need to customize or extend the setup for your environment.
3. Start the Platform
npm run dev
This launches:
The UbeCode web UI
Core backend services
A local development workspace
4. Open the Web Interface
http://localhost:3000
You can now:
Create a workspace
Define capabilities and epics
Capture specification and design artifacts
Explore how capabilities structure delivery and AI governance
5. Explore the SAWai Workflow
Begin in the Specification phase:
Define vision, themes, ideation, and storyboards
Then progress through:
Definition → Capabilities and epics
Design → UI assets and design integration
Execution → System, code, and runtime alignment
Each phase remains explicitly connected to the originating capability.

## Env
A GoLang-based microservices application for massively streamlined comprehensive software development using the **SAWai (Scaled Agile With AI)** methodology.

## What is SAWai?

**SAWai (Scaled Agile With AI)** is an evolution of traditional scaled agile frameworks designed specifically for AI-assisted development. Key principles:

- **Specification-First**: With AI accelerating code generation, the bottleneck shifts to specification quality. SAWai emphasizes thorough Vision, Ideation, and Storyboarding before implementation.
- **Four-Phase Workflow**:
  1. **SPECIFICATION** - Define what to build (Vision & Themes, Ideation, Storyboard)
  2. **DEFINITION** - Define the scope (Capabilities, Epics)
  3. **DESIGN** - Define how it looks (UI Assets, Framework, Styles)
  4. **EXECUTION** - Build and run (System, Code, Run)
- **AI-Amplified Delivery**: Traditional sprint velocities are superseded by AI-assisted generation, making well-defined requirements the primary success factor.
- **Simplified Hierarchy**: Capabilities → Epics (Features merged into Epics, Stories become implementation specs)

## Overview

UbeCode is a web application that facilitates capability-driven software development by providing:

- **Web UI** - Modern React-based interface with design system
- **Design Service** - Manages design artifacts and versioning
- **Capability Service** - Tracks capabilities, features, and user stories
- **Integration Service** - Connects with external design tools (Figma)
- **Role-Based Access Control** - Granular permission management for all pages
- **Real-time Collaboration** - Workspace sharing and cursor tracking
- **AI Governance** - Configurable AI principles and presets

## Architecture

The application follows a microservices architecture pattern where each service:
- Runs independently in its own container
- Communicates via REST APIs
- Can be scaled independently
- Has its own data store (when needed)

```

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Node.js 18+ or 20+ (for Web UI)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Make (optional, but recommended)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jareynolds/ubecode.git
cd ubecode
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Required
FIGMA_TOKEN=your_figma_personal_access_token
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_signing_secret

# Optional - Google OAuth (for Google Sign-In)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

# Database (defaults shown - override if needed)
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=6432
DB_USER=ubecode_user
DB_PASSWORD=ubecode_pass
DB_NAME=ubecode_db
```

**Getting API Keys:**

- **Figma Token**: Go to Figma Settings > Account > Personal access tokens > Generate new token
- **Anthropic API Key**: Get from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- **JWT Secret**: Generate a secure random string (e.g., `openssl rand -hex 32`)
- **Google OAuth**: Create credentials at [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)

### 3. Quick Start (Recommended)

Use the provided scripts to start everything:

```bash
# Start all services (backend + web UI)
./start.sh

# Check status of all services
./status.sh

# Stop all services
./stop.sh
```

The start script will:
- ✅ Check prerequisites (Docker, Node.js)
- ✅ Install Web UI dependencies automatically
- ✅ Start PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Start backend services in Docker (Integration, Design, Capability, Auth)
- ✅ Start Node.js API servers (Specification, Collaboration, Shared Workspace)
- ✅ Start Web UI development server (Vite)
- ✅ Display all service URLs and management commands

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
- Run `./status.sh` to check service health
- Check logs in `logs/` directory for errors
- Ensure Docker is running before starting services
- Use `lsof -i :PORT` to check for port conflicts

### 4. Build and Run with Docker Compose (Backend Only)

```bash
# Build all services
make docker-build

# Start all services
make docker-up

# View logs
make docker-logs

# Stop all services
make docker-down
```

### 5. Run Web UI Separately

```bash
cd web-ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 6. Run Services Locally (Development)

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Integration Service
make run-integration

# Terminal 2 - Design Service
make run-design

# Terminal 3 - Capability Service
make run-capability

# Terminal 4 - Web UI
cd web-ui && npm run dev
```
