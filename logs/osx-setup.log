==> Installing curl
==> Pouring curl--8.17.0.arm64_sequoia.bottle.1.tar.gz
==> Caveats
curl is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have curl first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/curl/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find curl you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/curl/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/curl/include"
